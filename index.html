        In the Netherlands, there is an A.I tool called the "Sturgeon" that can analylaze tissue from a tumor and helps them show how to operate on it.
    The tool can define what type of tumor it is, by aligning both the tumor and chemical modfications side by side.
    This A.I tool was first used on a frozen tumor that was taken from older operatons. It impressively diagonsed 45 up to 50 cases in 40 minutes with precise accuracy.
    It was then tested later on 25 on going brain surgeries being most on children.
